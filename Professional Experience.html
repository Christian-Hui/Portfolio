								<div class="image main"><img src="images/cheggterns.JPG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>During my time at <a href="https://www.chegg.com/about/" target="_blank">Chegg</a>, I was in charge of managing the <b>Chegg Skills</b> product, a platform to teach AI and data analytics
								courses to business professional at companies such as <b>Tesla</b> and <b>Morgan Stanley</b>. I viewed the product in different perspectives 
								through informed, data-driven decisions with applied user behavioral trend analysis using <b>SQL</b> and <b>Power BI</b>. To end off the internship, 
								I had the chance to present a future plan for a Chegg mobile app distributing to more than more than 700,000 students.</p>
								<p>Working at the heart of <b>Silicon Valley</b> through Chegg was truly a life-changing experience. Being among some of the 
								<b>world's most innovative tech companies</b> in Santa Clara fueled my passion for problem-solving and creativity. The culture 
								encouraged growth, from brainstorming on the next big product feature to contributing to projects that 
								reached thousands of students. Having been part of the <b>dynamic tech ecosystem</b>, I gained insight into how industry leaders approach innovation, 
								user-centric design, and data-driven decision-making. This internship not only expanded my technical skill set but also reinforced my 
								commitment to creating meaningful solutions in the tech space.

									<p>In-Theater Marketing Intern in Los Angeles, California</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/kfp4.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>At <a href="https://www.nbcuniversal.com/about" target="_blank">NBCUniversal</a>, I played a key role in executing innovative marketing strategies for over 20 movie theater companies across the country including 
								<b>AMC</b>, <b>Regal</b>, and <b>Cinemark</b>. From spearheading special promotions around <b>Kung Fu Panda 4</b> through creative event planning to orchestrating the 
								re-release of Oscar winning films <b>Oppenheimer</b> and <b>The Holdovers</b>, I contributed to campaigns that generated widespread attention. Partnering 
								with Asian American influencers and brands, I helped amplify audience engagement for Focus Features film <b>Didi</b> across social media. Additionally, I 
								completed over 20 competitive analysis decks highlighting the weekly trends within the entertainment industry. My work bridged creativity with data-driven 
								insights, ensuring each campaign resonated with diverse audiences.</p>
								<p>Being in Los Angeles,<b> the entertainment capital of the world</b>, was one of my biggest dreams as a film enthusiast. Constantly surrounded by the industry, I was amazed 
								by the fast creative energy that pushes <b>one of the most influential companies in the industry</b>. For my final task, I was able to work as a spotter for the <b>Monkey Man</b> premiere,
								organizing an event for over 1,000 attendees while watching over Dev Patel and his family. From numerous movie premieres to collaborative teams passionate about storytelling, 
								every day felt like a masterclass in the art and business of cinema. The whole culture of <b>Hollywood</b> was electric, and not only would it spark creativity, but the perspective on how 
								these timeless tales come to life and touch many souls was so unique. This only nurtured the excitement in me for connecting people through memorable content, leaving me 
								eager to contribute toward the future of entertainment.</p>

									<h1>Keboola</h1>
									<p>Data Analyst Intern in Prague, Czech Republic</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/keboola.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Through the <b>UCLA Global Internship Program</b>, I was able to intern at <a href="https://www.keboola.com/" target="_blank">Keboola</a> in Prague, Czech Republic a leading data operations platform. I drove significant business outcomes with advanced analytics. 
								By applying <b>R</b> and <b>SQL</b> to analyze the efficiency of multi-channel campaigns, I resulted in a direct increase of engagement via email and social media. I designed interactive <b>Tableau</b> 
								and <b>Confluence</b> dashboards to structure actionable insights in event participation trends for webinars joined by more than 300 participants.
								Beyond analytics, I collaborated with multiple cross-functional teams to drive improvements in customer success. I drove market research on Czech enterprises using <b>Python</b> 
								and <b>Excel</b>, created case studies, and drove business partnership outreach. I also presented optimization strategies for Keboola's internal 
								data pipelines, improving reporting efficiency and reducing overall turnaround times.
								<p>Interning in Prague was an unforgettable experience that broadened my perspective both personally and professionally. To live and work in this historic city has meant to be surrounded 
								every day by a unique blend of <b>old world charm</b> and <b>modern innovation</b>â€”from cobblestone streets lined with Gothic architecture to the thriving tech and business community. The collaborative atmosphere I encountered while working abroad 
								presented me with creative approaches toward problem solving and fostering relationships with coworkers of many backgrounds. In addition to this internship, I further studied economics at the <b>Prague University of Economics and Business</b>
								by taking courses related to game theory and behavioral economics, which was directly used in Keboola's work. This experience
								rose my awareness of how cross-cultural exchange serves and contributes to shaping new innovative solutions.</p>
