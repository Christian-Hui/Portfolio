									<h1>180 Degrees Consulting at UCLA</h1>
									<p>Director of Marketing & Senior Consultant</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/180board.JPG" alt="" /></div>
								<p><a href="https://www.180dc.org/" target="_blank">180 Degrees Consulting</a> is the <b>world's largest volunteer consultancy</b>, 
								operating globally with over 150 branches and a highly competitive <b>3% acceptance rate</b>. Its mission is to empower socially-conscious 
								organizations through high-quality, innovative consulting services that deliver practical and sustainable solutions. Our UCLA branch has 
								been recognized globally for excellence, including <b>Best Overall Branch in the Americas for 2023 and 2020</b>, and 
								<b>Most Innovative Branch in the Americas for 2021</b>.
								<p>As Director of Marketing, I transformed 180 Degrees Consulting’s digital presence, driving record-breaking engagement and outreach. By crafting 
								a series of strategic campaigns for our Instagram platform <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ucla180dc/" target="_blank"><b>(@ucla180dc)</b></a> and redesigning our <a href="https://www.ucla180dc.org/" target="_blank"><b>website</b></a>, I elevated 
								brand visibility and awareness on campus, ensuring a stronger pool of talent for the organization. My work also extended to the national level, 
								where I curated engaging content for the nationwide summit’s social media <a href="https://www.instagram.com/180degreesconsulting/?hl=en" target="_blank"><b>(@180degreesconsulting)</b></a>, 
								reaching an audience of over 3,000 attendees.</p>
								<p>As a Senior Consultant and project manager, I led a team of four in delivering impactful solutions for diverse clients. One highlight was working with an LGBTQ+ 
								storytelling organization, where we identified innovative <b>funding opportunities</b> and developed <b>grant proposals</b> to secure long-term support. For an education nonprofit, 
								I spearheaded the design of a <b>theory of change framework</b>, integrating key verticals to align their mission with measurable outcomes. Additionally, I authored a <b>white paper</b>
								for a sustainable microfarm, effectively articulating their vision and operational strategies to stakeholders. Through clear communication, thorough research, and 
								collaborative teamwork, I ensured each client received actionable insights and strategies tailored to their goals.</p>

								<p><a href="https://www.uclabea.com/" target="_blank">Business in Entertainment Association (BEA)</a> is the <b>leading entertainment organization</b> at UCLA. As the first and only club on campus dedicated solely to this field, BEA offers professional development, hands-on opportunities, and industry connections across Film, TV, Fashion, Sports, Music, Video Games, Cosmetics, 
								and Digital Media. As the Film/TV Committee Director, I have been at the center of curating experiences that bridge the gap between students and industry professionals. I collaborated with <b>Pascal Pictures</b> and <b>Focus Features</b> to devise a strategy for showcasing <b>Spider-Man: 
								Across the Spider-Verse</b> and <b>Lisa Frankenstein</b> through innovative marketing proposals. As a member, I was able to attend over 30 movie premieres and celebrity events to engage with talent personally.
								I also coordinated social media for the <b>Jurassic World Dominion</b> premiere, working directly with talent such as Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard that resulted in over 3 million views for promotional content.

								<p><a href="https://www.pseucla.com/" target="_blank">Pi Sigma Epsilon</a> is a co-ed professional business fraternity dedicated to the advancement of sales, marketing, and management with over <b>60 active chapters</b> and <b>50,000 members nationwide</b>.
								I serve as the Vice President of Operations at UCLA, driving initiatives that further strengthened both the impact of our chapter and the members. I worked on an in-depth three-month <b>integrated marketing and communications plan</b> for 
								<a href="https://playio.co/?LANG_CD=ENG#01" target="_blank"><b>Playio</b></a>, a mobile gaming application, which showed the capabilities of our chapter in developing actionable and industry-relevant solutions. I led a social media-driven fundraising 
								campaign that created over $2,000 in two weeks and organized large-scale events uniting 10 professional fraternities at UCLA. The event, for which I secured a budget of $10,000 to execute, attracted over 400 attendees, facilitating networking opportunities and professional growth.

									<p>Professional Musician and Performer</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/chui1.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Music has always been one of my biggest passions in my life. With <b>11 years of experience as a pianist</b> and <b>7 years as a violinist</b>, including multiple performances at <b>Carnegie Hall</b>, I am always searching for ways to share my passion through different mediums. As chui, I am a <b>music producer </b>and <b>DJ</b> who builds a strong brand by 
								mixing various genres of music I have collected from both Atlanta and Los Angeles. Drawing inspiration from Rap, Pop, EDM, and K-Pop, I create interactive performances that allow audiences to connect on a deep level emotionally. My genre-bending and trend-pulling have earned me <b>over 2 million views</b> on TikTok, showing the world 
								my creative vision. The highlights of my journey so far have been performing at high-profile events like <b>Electrik Seoul by Insomniac Events</b>, where I was able to sell out a crowd of 800+ attendees with a unique fusion of K-Pop and EDM. I also headlined a promotional concert at UC Irvine, reaching an audience of over 1,000 students, 
								and opened for iconic artist <b>Soulja Boy</b>. What also excited me about them individually was the opportunity provided during each event to extend artistry into strategic marketing skills, impacting attendance and involvement. Beyond the performance stages, video editing and strategic tips on content virality stand out as ways in which 
								I build an engaging digital presence for myself and all lovers of my work, collaborative artists inclusive. As chui, I am not only an artist, but an <i>innovative narrator</i> in the music industry.</p>
